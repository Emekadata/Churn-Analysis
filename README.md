# Churn Analysis of a Retail Dataset

## Project Overview
This project aims to perform customer churn analysis for a retail dataset, using machine learning techniques to identify customers who are likely to stop engaging with the retail business. By identifying churn patterns, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers.

The dataset used contains information on customer transactions, including product purchases, invoice details, and customer demographics.

## Dataset
The retail dataset includes the following columns:

- **InvoiceNo**: Unique invoice number.
- **StockCode**: Product code.
- **Description**: Product description.
- **Quantity**: Number of products sold per invoice.
- **InvoiceDate**: Date and time of the invoice.
- **UnitPrice**: Price per unit of the product.
- **CustomerID**: Unique customer identification number.
- **Country**: Country where the customer resides.

## Objective
The main objective of this analysis is to:
1. Identify patterns in customer churn behavior.
2. Build a model to predict customer churn.
3. Provide actionable insights for customer retention.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used in this analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
```

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.
   - Handled missing values and duplicates.
   - Feature engineering: Created relevant features for churn prediction.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized key trends and insights using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
   - Analyzed customer purchase patterns, geographical distributions, and other important features.

3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Used `KMeans` clustering to group customers based on purchasing behavior.
   - Analyzed different segments to identify high-risk churn groups.

4. **Churn Prediction**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
   - Used `Logistic Regression` and `RandomForestRegressor` to predict customer churn.
   - Evaluated models using `classification_report`, `mean_absolute_error`, and `r2_score`.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Compared model performance to select the most effective model.
   - Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the classification models.

6. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - Performed cosine similarity analysis to identify similar customers and recommend targeted interventions.

## Results
- The predictive models achieved good accuracy and were able to identify potential churners with reasonable precision and recall.
- Customer segmentation provided insights into different behavior patterns, and the high-risk segments were identified for further analysis.

## Visualizations
Several visualizations were generated to aid the analysis, including:
- Customer segmentation plots
- Churn prediction probability distributions
- Feature importance for churn prediction
- Cosine similarity matrix

## Installation

To run the analysis, make sure to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
```

## How to Run

2. Install the required libraries using the command above.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to perform the analysis.

## Conclusion
By predicting customer churn and identifying high-risk groups, businesses can take proactive steps to improve customer retention. This analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior patterns that can be leveraged to reduce churn.
